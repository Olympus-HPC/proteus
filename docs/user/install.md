# Installation

Proteus is currently distributed through its Git repository, which you can use
to build and install the library.
We recommend using the latest `main` branch, which is well-tested, stable, and
includes the most recent features.

Building Proteus installs two components:
- the **Proteus LLVM plugin pass** (`ProteusPass`), and
- the **Proteus runtime library** (`libproteus`).

The LLVM plugin pass is necessary **only if** you use the Code annotation
interface and requires compiling your application with Clang, besides linking with `libproteus`.
If you the DSL or C++ frontend APIs then you only need to link your code with `libproteus`.
Both must be integrated into your applicationâ€™s build system.
See [Integration](integration.md) section for more details on integrating with your build system.


## Building

Proteus uses `cmake` for building and requires an existing LLVM installation (CI
tests cover LLVM 18/19 with CUDA 12.2 and AMD ROCm versions 6.2.1, 6.3.1, 6.4.1).

The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` defines the following build options:

* `BUILD_SHARED`: build Proteus as a shared library (default is static).
* `ENABLE_TESTS`: build Proteus tests.
* `PROTEUS_ENABLE_HIP`: enable HIP support.
* `PROTEUS_ENABLE_CUDA`: enable CUDA support.
* `PROTEUS_ENABLE_TIME_TRACING`: generate a JSON time-trace file for Proteus operations (for flame graphs visualization).

!!! info "Host, CUDA and HIP support"
    Proteus always supports host JIT compilation.
    You can additionally enable CUDA or HIP JIT compilation by setting
    `PROTEUS_ENABLE_CUDA` or `PROTEUS_ENABLE_HIP` respectively.

A typical build looks like this:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Olympus-HPC/proteus.git
cd proteus
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-path> <other options> ..
make -j install
```

## Testing

We recommend enabling tests when deploying Proteus on a new machine and running them once to verify the installation:
```shell
cd build
make test
```
