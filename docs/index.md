# Proteus documentation

Proteus is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and optimization library for C and
C++.
It supports both CPU and GPU execution through CUDA and HIP.

With Proteus, you can embed JIT compilation into your applications to specialize
code at runtime.
By annotating functions or kernels — or by using the provided APIs — you can fold
runtime values into generated code, unlocking optimizations such as loop
unrolling, constant propagation, and control-flow simplification that go beyond
what static compilers can achieve.

This site provides the user guide and  developers' manual for
[Proteus](https://github.com/Olympus-HPC/proteus).
