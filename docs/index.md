# The Proteus documentation

Proteus is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and optimization library for C/C++
codes.
It supports both CPU and CUDA/HIP GPU codes.

Proteus provides an interface for programmers to annotate functions/kernels for
JIT execution and specify function arguments to specialize code generation for,
thereby turbocharging JIT compiler optimization.

This documentation contains the user guide and  developers' manual for
[Proteus](https://github.com/Olympus-HPC/proteus).
