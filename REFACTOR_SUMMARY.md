# Proteus Refactoring - Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring progress of the Proteus codebase into a component-based architecture. It outlines what has been implemented so far and what remains to be done.

## Completed Components

1. **Engine** (Implemented)
   - Base class with common functionality
   - CPU implementation (CPUEngine)
   - CUDA implementation (CUDAEngine)
   - HIP implementation (HIPEngine)
   - Feature flags for migration

2. **CompilationTask** (Implemented)
   - Container for all compilation parameters
   - Hash-based identification
   - Module cloning and specialization

3. **Builder** (Implemented)
   - Abstract interface
   - SyncBuilder implementation
   - AsyncBuilder implementation

4. **CompilationResult** (Implemented)
   - Function pointer storage and retrieval
   - Metadata for compiled functions

5. **Cache** (Implemented)
   - Abstract interface
   - Memory, disk, and hierarchical implementations
   - CacheAdapter for migration

6. **Code** (Implemented)
   - LLVM IR representation
   - Hash generation
   - Cloning capability

7. **CodeContext** (Partially Implemented)
   - Basic functionality for function registry
   - Lambda registration

## Integration Status

- Engine implements and coordinates most functionality
- JitEngineHost has been updated with optional use of the new architecture
- Conditional compilation via USE_NEW_ENGINE and USE_NEW_CACHE flags
- Test program for Engine component has been added

## Remaining Work

1. **Complete JitEngineDevice refactoring**
   - Migrate JitEngineDeviceCUDA to CUDAEngine
   - Migrate JitEngineDeviceHIP to HIPEngine
   - Update kernel launch mechanisms to use the new architecture

2. **CodeContext enhancements**
   - Fully separate function/lambda registry
   - Improve metadata handling

3. **Additional tests**
   - Create GPU-specific tests for CUDAEngine and HIPEngine
   - More comprehensive test coverage for all components

4. **Full migration**
   - Remove feature flags and complete transition
   - Update all code paths to use the new components
   - Deprecate old interfaces

5. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation for new architecture
   - Add developer guidelines for component extension

## Migration Strategy

The refactoring follows a gradual approach with these steps:

1. Implement new components while maintaining backward compatibility
2. Add adapter classes to bridge old and new implementations
3. Introduce feature flags to toggle between architectures
4. Refactor backend-specific code (CPU first, then CUDA/HIP)
5. Update tests to verify new implementations
6. Complete migration by removing old code paths

## Next Steps

1. Implement concrete specializations of Engine for CUDA and HIP backends
2. Enhance the test coverage for different backends
3. Complete the CodeContext implementation
4. Begin gradual migration of GPU-related components

## Refactoring Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a focused responsibility
2. **Modularity**: Components can be enhanced or replaced independently
3. **Extensibility**: New backends or optimizations can be added easily
4. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Maintainability**: Code is more organized and follows clear patterns
6. **Performance**: Specialized backends can optimize for their targets
